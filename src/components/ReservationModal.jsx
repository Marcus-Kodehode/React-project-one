Your strength isnâ€™t in conquest but in connection; your victories arenâ€™t in battles won but in the lives youâ€™ve brightened. So take a seat, enjoy the viewâ€”youâ€™ve earned it.

In this grand ballroom of life, you do not just walk; you float. You do not just speak; you enchant. And just as the stars gather in admiration of the moon, so do people gather in admiration of you. Take your seat, let the music play, and know that wherever you are, the world is brighter because of it.
